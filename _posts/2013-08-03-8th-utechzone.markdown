There are four subjects of this competition: face, gender, expression and age recognition. The program was developed to detect human faces from the video and extract the features of faces to do the recognition using trained model. We cross-testing algorithms and models to optimize the performance of recognition rate. In face recognition part, histograms of Shearlet Coefficients(HSC) algorithm was implemented as a new feature
with recognition rate around 78% with Fisherfaces model.
