The competition are separated into three subjects: fall detection, left object detection and phone detection. The image processing algorithms were implemented to deal with the problem in video. In fall detection part, the foreground objects were retrieved by generating a background model named SACON. And the behavior of objects were under observation using object tracking, geometrical feature extraction methods.
