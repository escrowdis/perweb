<!-- BME 4101 Mechatronics and Laboratory -->

In the lecture Mechatronics and Laboratory, we've learned the theories and functions of sensors, mechanism deisgn, signal processing, and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The final project required us to use all the knowledge to integrate a system up. Three classmates and I came up with an idea to build an automatic canopy system equipped with rain detection to prevent sun-dry clothes hanging outdoors getting wet. To detect the rain, a vibration sensor, SHOCK-801S and a capacitive-sensing circuit kit were applied outdoors to sense the falling raindrop. When a raindrop hit the sensor board, the circuit on the sensor trace will be closed due to the water stayed on it and the force will vibrate the sensor plate. We determine this condition as rain mode and the programmed PLC will receive this signal and then trigger the motor to open the canopy. We also self-made the components in our department's factory, such as cutting a wood plate with a scroll saw and cutting an acrylic plate with a laser cutting machine. Although it's a prototype, I learned how to design and assemble a circuit, program the code on PLC, and control the stepping motor.
